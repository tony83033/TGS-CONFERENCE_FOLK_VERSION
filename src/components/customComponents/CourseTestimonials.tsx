    Vimal Sir is outstanding while teaching complex and advanced topics, as he teaches us in such a way that even someone without technical background one can easily grasp and this is the main reason I have been following him since long.

    Before his session, I had tried to understand DevSecOps through various technical channels, but I didn't get a clear picture. However, in just initial hours of Vimal Sir’s session, he made the concept very much clearer. Then, over the next two hours, he simplified DevSecOps further, helping me gain valuable insights that sparked my interest in exploring the topic more deeply.
    
    I am Thankful to Vimal Sir for in-depth course on DevSecOps and looking more indepth session from him, and Im grateful for his teachings for current and upcoming valuable training sessions.`,

Attending the System Design workshop by Vimal Daga Sir was a great learning experience. He explained complex topics like scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing in simple terms, making it easy to understand. The examples he gave helped us see how these concepts are used in real projects. I learned how to make systems more efficient and reliable by balancing important factors like performance and cost. I'm excited to apply these new skills in my future projects!

The workshop was incredibly beneficial! I'm excited about the practical applications of CI/CD and AWS services. I plan to start by working on a personal project to implement a deployment pipeline and use AWS CodeDeploy for automation. Collaborating with others will definitely enhance the learning experience, and I'm eager to stay updated with new DevOps trends to improve my skills continuously.
I'm really looking forward to applying these insights!
